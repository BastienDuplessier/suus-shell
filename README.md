# Super Ultimate Unique Shell
This project is about me learning some rust to be a better programmer. It will implement some basic commands and syntax and maybe more.

## Dependencies

You need to install Rust (1.18.0-nightly) and Cargo (0.19.0-nightly)

## Building

First build the project with cargo
```
  cargo build --release
```
Then, just run the binary created default is
```
  target/release/suus-shell
```

## Implemented commands
Command | State
------------ | -------------
echo | todo
pwd | todo
ls | todo
cd | todo

## Origin of the name
This shell will be both unique and ultimate. That's why it's in the name
